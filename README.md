  ## Description
  This Weather Dashboard uses the power of OpenWeather API to bring your local weather to you. Not only does it provide you with realtime weather information for your searched city, but it also provides a 5-day forecast. If you forget which city you searched, this app will also save your previously searched cities so that you can access updated information with one click.

  ## Usage
  The repository greets you with the index.html and the Assets folder which includes the style.css and script.js folders. Right click on the index.html page to open the application in your browser. From there, you can type a city into the search window and click the SEARCH button. As you search other cities, your previously searched cities will be stored. You can also clear your search history if it is no longer needed. For a visual explanation of how this works, please view the following video.
